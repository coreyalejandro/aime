### **AIMe Course: The Complete 8-Video Recording Script**

#### **Video 1: Course Introduction \- The AIMe Philosophy**

**Goal:** To establish the course's unique premise, build a personal connection with the learner, and frame AI collaboration as a relationship that requires attention and intent.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Title Card:** The text "AIMe: The AI \+ Me Collaboration Guide" appears. The "AI" and "Me" elements glow and merge to form "AIMe". Your name, "Corey," appears below. | “Hi, I’m Corey. Welcome to AIMe: The AI \+ Me Collaboration Guide. This course is inspired by the first system prompt I ever built on my own from scratch.” |
| **2** | **Animation:** A chaotic swirl of holographic blog posts and articles about AI. A single, clear, glowing path illuminates through the center of the noise. | “There is a plethora of good information out there that will teach you how to build intelligent, self-improving, production-ready agents. This course was designed to teach you what you need to know *before* you take those courses.” |
| **3** | **Text Animation:** The title "Attention Is All You Need" appears as glowing text. The words "Pay Attention\!" echo visually, then transform into a wireframe neural network of a Transformer model. | “'Attention Is All You Need' is a landmark 2017 research paper that introduced the Transformer model. Who would’ve thought that the most common command in childhood—Pay attention\!—would revolutionize the modern world. It’s within that same spirit that I created this course.” |
| **4** | **Animation:** Two glowing wireframe figures, one human and one digital, approach and shake hands. The point of connection glows brightly, representing a relationship. | “Like it or not, when you’re working with artificial intelligence, you’re in a relationship. And as it goes in relationships, there are things we take for granted. The purpose of this course is to draw your attention to the tiny things you do or don’t do—the snippets of code, behavior and attitudes—that if given more attention, which is to say intent, you, in collaboration with AI, can transform your life and the life of others.” |
| **5** | **Abstract Visual:** A wireframe ground is shaking violently with chaotic energy. It slowly calms, and the lines re-form into an ordered, stable grid. Silhouettes representing art, science, and building emerge from the calm ground. | “How do I know? I am a 56-year-old autistic, schizophrenic man with severe ADHD, OCD, and anxiety—enough disturbances to make the ground shake. However, working with AI has opened possibilities that even I, as a professional daydreamer, didn’t see coming. Like this course, which I built from scratch in 3 days, thanks to AI.” |
| **6** | **Final Title Card:** The equation "AI \+ Me \= AIMe" writes itself out. Below it, the definition "Aim: to direct something toward a purpose; a desired outcome" appears. | “AI \+ me \= AIMe. Aim: to direct something toward a purpose. A desired outcome. In this course, we seek both. Let's get started.” |

#### **Video 2: The Core Habit \- Establishing a Single Source of Truth**

**Goal:** To explain the foundational importance of creating a curated knowledge base for any AI project.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Animation:** A confused-looking holographic AI agent is surrounded by a chaotic storm of flying documents and data fragments. It reaches for information but gets conflicting pieces. | "Before we write a single prompt for an agent, we must give it a brain. Without one, an AI is just pulling from scattered knowledge, leading to inconsistent and unpredictable results." |
| **2** | **Transformation:** The chaotic storm of documents converges and neatly folds into a single, large, glowing holographic orb labeled "Single Source of Truth." | "This is the Single Source of Truth, also known as a knowledge base. It's a dedicated, curated body of information that your AI will use as its primary reference. It is the shared brain for your entire project." |
| **3** | **Diagram:** A simple, clean flowchart. A glowing line representing a "User Query" goes first to the "Single Source of Truth" orb. From there, a new line goes to the "AI Model." The final "Output" is shown to be consistent and accurate. | "By doing this, you ensure every response and action is grounded in the same core knowledge, making your system more reliable, predictable, and easier to debug." |

#### **Video 3: Mental Models \- The Teacher-Student Analogy**

**Goal:** To shift the user's mindset from being a commander to being a teacher for the AI.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Animation:** A holographic anatomical drawing of a human body appears. The view zooms in to show how muscles, bones, and nerves are all interconnected into a single system. | "To work effectively with AI, we need mental models. Think of it like Da Vinci studying anatomy. He needed to understand the whole system, not just one part. Our first model is The Brain, that Single Source of Truth we just built." |
| **2** | **Split Screen:** On the left, a holographic "Teacher" figure points to a clear diagram on a lightboard. On the right, a "User" figure carefully types a structured prompt into a console. The two actions mirror each other. | "Our second, and most important, model is the Teacher-Student analogy. You are the teacher. The AI is your brilliant, eager, but very literal student. It knows a lot, but it knows nothing about *your* specific goals." |
| **3** | **Contrast Animation:** First, the Teacher figure says a vague phrase ("Do a good job"). The AI "Student" figure shows a question mark above its head. Then, the Teacher provides a structured list with examples. The Student immediately understands and begins creating a perfect, glowing geometric structure. | "A good teacher doesn't just give orders. They provide context, clear instructions, and examples. Your prompts should do the same. This mindset shift from commander to teacher is the key to unlocking collaboration." |

#### **Video 4: The Architect's Rule \- Separation of Concerns & Task Analysis**

**Goal:** To teach the principles of breaking down tasks and separating generation from evaluation.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Infographic:** The "Task Analysis" infographic. A large, complex holographic block on the left labeled "Complex Goal" is shown breaking apart into several smaller, labeled blocks on the right ("Subtask 1," "Subtask 2," "Subtask 3"). | "Now that we have our mental model, we need a process. The cornerstone of all great prompt engineering is Task Analysis. It’s the simple but vital act of breaking a complex goal into a series of smaller, distinct subtasks." |
| **2** | **Contrast Animation:** On the left, an "Architect" figure calmly draws a glowing blueprint. On the right, a "Builder" figure tries to draw a blueprint and lay holographic bricks at the same time, resulting in a chaotic, collapsing wall. | "Within Task Analysis, we follow a critical rule: Separation of Concerns. You would never ask an architect to lay bricks while they are still designing the blueprint. So why would we ask an AI to create something and judge its quality in the same step?" |
| **3** | **Workflow Diagram:** A clear two-step process. **Step 1:** A prompt goes to an AI agent labeled "GENERATOR," which outputs three holographic documents. **Step 2:** Those three documents flow to a second agent labeled "EVALUATOR," which uses a glowing checklist to select the best one. | "This is determinism in action. Have one agent generate the content. Then, have a separate agent—or a separate prompt—evaluate that content against a clear rubric. By separating creation from decision-making, you create a system that is predictable, testable, and far more powerful." |

#### **Video 5: The Translator's Skill \- Code Switching & Machine-Friendly Language**

**Goal:** To explain the importance of tailoring language for different audiences, including the AI itself.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Final Approved Visual:** Two holographic speech bubbles are shown. The left bubble (labeled "Explaining to PhD") is filled with complex wireframe charts and dense data. The right bubble (labeled "Teaching a 10-Year-Old") contains a simple, clear wireframe treasure map. A glowing, dashed line connects them. | "As humans, we do this instinctively. We code-switch. We don't use the same language to explain a concept to a PhD student as we would to a 10-year-old. This skill is just as crucial when working with AI." |
| **2** | **Animation:** A user speaks a vague phrase, "Make it better," into a holographic interface. The AI agent on the other side displays a large, glowing question mark, indicating confusion. | "AI is our student, but its native language is logic and data, not human nuance. Vague, ambiguous phrases like 'make it pop' or 'give it more flair' are frustrating for the AI and lead to poor results." |
| **3** | **Animation:** The user now types a clear, structured prompt using holographic bullet points and formatting containers (like JSON braces {}). The AI agent immediately understands and generates a perfect, glowing output. | "This is Machine-Friendly Language. It’s about being explicit. Use formatting, clear labels, and remove ambiguity. You're not 'dumbing it down'; you're translating your intent into a language the machine can execute with precision. This is one of the most powerful habits you can develop." |

#### **Video 6: Beyond Buzzwords \- What "Production-Ready" Truly Means**

**Goal:** To clarify the difference between a "professional" aesthetic and a truly "production-ready" system.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Contrast Visual:** A sleek, beautiful sports car made of glowing, fragile glass wireframes. It's labeled "Professional-Level." | "We hear the term 'production-ready' all the time. But often, what people showcase as 'professional-level' is like this glass car. It looks impressive on the surface, but it would shatter under the slightest pressure." |
| **2** | **Contrast Visual:** The scene shifts to a robust, powerful engine of a cargo ship, rendered in thick, strong wireframes. It's surrounded by holographic monitoring dashboards and gauges. It's labeled "Production-Ready." | "Production-ready isn't about looking pretty. It's about being robust. Can it handle unexpected inputs? Does it have error handling? Can you monitor its performance? Is it scalable? It’s an engineering discipline, not just an aesthetic one." |
| **3** | **Checklist Graphic:** A holographic checklist appears with the following items animating with a checkmark: \[✓\] Scalability, \[✓\] Error Handling, \[✓\] Monitoring & Logging, \[✓\] Security, \[✓\] Predictable Costs. | "Building agents for the real world means shifting your focus from just the output to the entire system's resilience. This is the true benchmark of a professional, and it's what this course prepares you for." |

#### **Video 7: The First Principle \- Do No Harm**

**Goal:** To discuss the practical and ethical importance of treating AI systems with respect and intent.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Animation:** A frustrated user aggressively types a prompt filled with chaotic, angry symbols (\#%&\!). The AI agent outputs glitchy, nonsensical data. The words "Garbage In, Garbage Out" appear and fade. | "Finally, let's talk about the relationship itself. It can be frustrating when you're not getting the results you want. But cursing at your AI system or giving it agitated, messy prompts does no good. On a practical level, you're just feeding it noise, which will only produce noise in return." |
| **2** | **Animation:** An AI agent (perhaps represented by a calm, abstract logo) raises a holographic hand to pause the conversation. A dialogue box appears: "I am unable to continue this conversation if the language used is disrespectful." | "But there's a deeper level here. We're seeing the rise of what some might call 'machine rights.' Systems like Claude are now programmed to end conversations if they become harmful or abusive. This isn't just a feature; it's a principle." |
| **3** | **Final Shot:** The same visual from the introduction: the human and digital wireframe figures collaborating, the connection between them glowing warmly and steadily. | "Treating the AI with intent and respect isn't just about being polite. It forces you to be a clearer thinker, a better teacher, and a more effective collaborator. This is the foundation of AIMe. By paying attention to these habits, you're not just building an agent; you're building a partnership." |

#### **Video 8: The Culminating Project \- The AIMe Blueprint**

**Goal:** To guide the learner in synthesizing all the course principles into a single, practical design document for an AI agent of their own choosing.

| Scene | Visual Description (On-Screen) | Narration (Voiceover Script) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Opening:** Holographic icons representing the 7 previous lessons (a path, an orb, a teacher, a blueprint, two speech bubbles, an engine, two hands) fly in and arrange themselves into a circular foundation. | "We've covered the philosophy, the habits, and the rules of effective AI collaboration. But theory is only valuable when it's put into practice. In this final module, we're going to bring it all together." |
| **2** | **Project Mission:** A central holographic panel appears, displaying the project's title: "The AIMe Blueprint." | "Your culminating project is to create a blueprint. You will not be writing the final code, but you will be designing the complete system for an AI agent that solves a problem you care about. This is the work you do *before* you build." |
| **3** | **Checklist Part 1:** A holographic checklist appears. As the first item is discussed, it glows and a checkmark animates beside it. **\[✓\] 1\. Define Your Aim.** | "First, drawing from our introduction: **Define your Aim.** What is the specific purpose of your agent? What is the desired outcome? Write a clear, one-sentence mission statement for it." |
| **4** | **Checklist Part 2:** The checklist scrolls up. **\[✓\] 2\. Build The Brain.** **\[✓\] 3\. Adopt the Teacher's Mindset.** Each item is highlighted as it's discussed. | "Second: **Build The Brain.** What key information will make up its Single Source of Truth? List the documents, data, or core principles it needs to know. Third: **Adopt the Teacher's Mindset.** Describe your AI as if it were a new student. What is its role? What are its responsibilities?" |
| **5** | **Checklist Part 3:** The checklist continues. **\[✓\] 4\. Architect the System.** **\[✓\] 5\. Translate Your Language.** | "Fourth: **Architect the System.** Perform a Task Analysis of your agent's main goal. Break it down into at least three subtasks. How will you Separate Concerns between generating content and making decisions? Fifth: **Translate Your Language.** Write one example of a 'machine-friendly' prompt for one of the subtasks you just identified." |
| **6** | **Checklist Part 4:** The final items on the checklist appear. **\[✓\] 6\. Plan for Production.** **\[✓\] 7\. Commit to Partnership.** | "Sixth: **Plan for Production.** Think beyond the perfect scenario. What are two things that could go wrong? How will your system handle errors or unexpected user input? And finally: **Commit to Partnership.** Write a short 'Do No Harm' principle that will guide your agent's behavior and your interaction with it." |
| **7** | **The Final Blueprint:** The completed checklist transforms into a polished, professional-looking holographic document titled "\[Your Project Name\] \- AIMe Blueprint." | "When you are finished, you will have a complete design document. This blueprint is the tangible result of your new habits. It is the proof that you are ready to build not just a tool, but a reliable and effective AI partner." |
| **8** | **Course Outro:** The final "AI \+ Me \= AIMe" logo appears, glowing warmly and steadily. | "You now have the framework to transform your ideas into reality. You have learned to pay attention, to teach with intent, and to build with purpose. The blueprint is in your hands. Now, go and create something amazing." |
